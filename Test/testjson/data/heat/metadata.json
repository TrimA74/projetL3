  "description": "The physical problem involves one-dimension heat diffusion through a multi-layer wall. The latter is composed of a load material and an insulation part. The wall is submitted to climatic transient boundary conditions on one side and sinusoidal temperature variation on the other side. A parametric solution is computed as a function of the space and time coordinates, as well as the thermal insulation thickness and the load material thermal diffusivity."
